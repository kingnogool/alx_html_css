## Project: `0x01. HTML/CSS: Basic` (`css_basic` directory)

This directory (`css_basic`) holds the solution for the "0x01. HTML/CSS: Basic" project. It demonstrates foundational concepts of web development using HTML and CSS.

### Learning Objectives Achieved:

At the completion of this project, I am expected to be able to explain:

*   What is CSS
*   How to add style to an element (using external stylesheets)
*   What is a class and how it's used
*   What is a selector and basic types
*   How to compute CSS Specificity Value
*   What are Box properties in CSS (Box Model)
*   How the browser loads a webpage

### Project Tasks & Concepts Covered:

*   **0. Some early styling:** Setting up `base.css` and `styles.css` and linking them in HTML documents (`index.html`, `tweets.html`).
*   **1. Positioning (Flexbox Layout):** Implementing a responsive web page layout using CSS Flexbox for `header`, `main` (containing `article` and `aside`), and `footer`.
    *   The layout is designed such that `header`, `main`, and `footer` stack vertically.
    *   Within `main`, `article` and `aside` are now also stacked vertically across all screen sizes as per the final layout requirement.
*   **2. Responsive web design:** Implementing a viewport meta tag in `index.html` and utilizing the `works_on_smartphone` class on the `<body>` to ensure proper rendering on mobile devices and responsive behavior.
*   **3. Some more styling:** Adding custom visual styles (colors, fonts, spacing) to elements, incorporating a unicode character logo, and ensuring styling within the `<article>` tag. The overall Flexbox structure remains intact, with the header navigation designed to be horizontal on desktop and stack vertically on mobile (within the header).

### Technologies Used:

*   HTML5
*   CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)

### How to View:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    `git clone https://github.com/kingnogool/alx_html_css.git`
2.  Navigate into the `css_basic` directory:
    `cd alx_html_css/css_basic`
3.  Open `index.html` or `tweets.html` in your web browser.
